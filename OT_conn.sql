--Develop a PL/SQL procedure that takes a year (v_year IN) as an input parameter and determines the percentage of canceled orders for that year. 
--The procedure should follow these rules:
--Procedure Logic:
--	i) Calculate the percentage of canceled orders within the given year 
--	ii) If orders exist but none were canceled, display: "No orders were canceled."
--	iii) If no orders exist for the given year, handle the exception and display: "No orders found for the year."
--	iv) If canceled orders exist, display the result as: "Order cancellation status is 7%."

--3) Develop a PL/SQL function named get_business_contact that takes a single input parameter: customer_id (the unique identifier of a customer).
--The function should:
--	i) Retrieve the first name and last name of the business contact person associated with the given customer_id.
--	ii) Concatenate these names into a single string following a specific format: first_name last_name
--	iii) Assume there is a title associated with the contact person (e.g., 'Mr.', 'Ms.', 'Mrs.'). example "Mr/Mrs. Nancy Jones"
--	For example, if the title is 'Mr.', the first name is 'FLOR', and the last name is 'STONE', the function should return the string "Mr. FLOR STONE".
--	The function should then return this formatted string containing the customer's business contact person's full name with the title  in capital letter.

--when you give it a product's unique ID, will tell you where that product is stored and how many are currently in stock.

--where 'San Francisco' is the warehouse name and '255' is the number of that product in stock there.
